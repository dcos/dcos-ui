# DC/OS UI [![Velocity](http://velocity.mesosphere.com/service/velocity/buildStatus/icon?job=public-dcos-ui-master)](http://velocity.mesosphere.com/service/velocity/view/DCOS%20UI/job/public-dcos-ui-master/)

## Requirements

Node 4.x (and above) is **required**. We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to keep multiple Node versions on your system.



## DC/OS Installation Instructions:
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant) to install a local cluster.
2. In your dcos-vagrant repo from the previous step, run:

  ```
  vagrant ssh m1
  ```

3. Open `nginx.conf` for adminrouter with:

  ```
  sudo vi /opt/mesosphere/active/adminrouter/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
  ```

4. Find the line:

  ```
  root /opt/mesosphere/active/dcos-ui/usr;
  ```

  and comment out by changing the line to:

  ```
  # root /opt/mesosphere/active/dcos-ui/usr;
  ```

5. Right below the commented out line, add

  ```
  location ~ ^/(?!service|mesos).*\.(js|css|html|png|jpg|gif|jpeg|swf|map)$ {
    expires -1;
    add_header Cache-Control "no-store";
    proxy_pass http://10.0.2.2:4200;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Connection "";
  }
  ```
6. Save and quit vi
7. Restart adminrouter with `sudo service dcos-adminrouter restart`. Your cluster is now prepped for local development.
8. [Start](#user-content-dcos-ui-1) your local development server for DC/OS.
9. Navigate to http://m1.dcos.

**NOTE:** http://m1.dcos will only resolve if both your DC/OS UI Server and DC/OS Cluster are operational and running.

## DC/OS UI

This repository contains the DC/OS UI application.

##### Installation Instructions:

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/dcos/dcos-ui)
2. Install [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)
3. Install development dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install
  npm install -g gulp
  ```

4. Setup development project configuration

  * Copy `src/js/config/Config.template.js` to `src/js/config/Config.dev.js`
  * Override variables in `Config.dev.js` to reflect your local development configuration

5. Run development environment

  ```sh
  npm run serve
  ```

After installing all development dependencies and configuring your local environment (steps 1-4 above), you can run test by running `npm test`.  You can build assets, without actually running the DC/OS UI server by running `npm run dist`.  If you are actively developing, you may want to run `npm run livereload` to avoid having to refresh your browser with every change.

## Adding npm Package Dependencies

If you want to add a new npm package to 'node_modules':

1. Install the new package
  * Install and save dependencies in `package.json`

    ```
    npm install [your package] --save
    ```

  * Then, add the package to devDependencies

    ```
    npm install [your package] --save-dev
    ```

2. Create a synced npm-shrinkwrap.json with devDependencies included by running

    ```
    npm shrinkwrap --dev
    ```

3. Commit to repository

## Development Setup (Sublime Text Only)

1. Add the following to your Sublime Text User Settings:

  ```json
  {
    ...
    "rulers": [80], // lines no longer than 80 chars
    "tab_size": 2, // use two spaces for indentation
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true, // use spaces for indentation
    "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true, // add newline on save
    "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true, // trim trailing white space on save
    "default_line_ending": "unix"
  }
  ```

2. Add Sublime-linter with jshint & jsxhint:

  * Installing SublimeLinter is straightforward using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installing-via-pc)
  * SublimeLinter-eslint needs a global eslint in your system, see [instructions](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#sublimelinter-eslint)

3. Syntax Highlihgting for files containing JSX

  * Install Babel using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime). From here you can decide to use Babel for all .js files. See their docs for that. If you don't want to do that, continue reading.
  * Installing ApplySyntax using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](https://github.com/facelessuser/ApplySyntax)
  * Open up the user configuration file for ApplySyntax: `Sublime Text` -> `Preferences` -> `Package Settings` -> `ApplySyntax` -> `Settings - User`
  * Replace the contents with this:

    ```
    {
      // Put your custom syntax rules here:
      "syntaxes": [
        {
          "name": "Babel/JavaScript (Babel)",
          "rules": [
            {"first_line": "^\\/\\*\\*\\s@jsx\\sReact\\.DOM\\s\\*\\/"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
