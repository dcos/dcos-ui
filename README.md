# DC/OS UI [![Velocity](http://velocity.mesosphere.com/service/velocity/buildStatus/icon?job=public-dcos-ui-master)](http://velocity.mesosphere.com/service/velocity/view/DCOS%20UI/job/public-dcos-ui-master/)

## Requirements

Node 4.x and NPM 3.x (and above) are **required**. We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to keep multiple Node versions on your system.



## DC/OS Installation Instructions:
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant) to install a local cluster.
2. Clone this repo:

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:dcos/dcos-ui.git && cd dcos-ui
  ```

3. Install dependencies:

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

4. Add developer files for config overrides:

  ```sh
  npm run scaffold
  ```
  This will create `webpack/proxy.dev.js` and `src/js/config/Config.dev.js`. These files aren't tracked by git and provide a place to override proxy and general dcos-ui configuration.

5. Start the development server:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

6. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Using External Plugins

DC/OS UI comes bundled with some internal plugins within the `/plugins` directory. You can also load more plugins from another directory and they will be loaded into DC/OS UI along with the internal plugins. To set a directory for external plugins run:
```sh
npm config set externalplugins ../relative/path/to/plugins/directory
```

## Adding npm Package Dependencies

If you want to add a new npm package to 'node_modules':

1. Install the new package
  * Install and save dependencies in `package.json`

    ```
    npm install [your package] --save
    ```

  * Then, add the package to devDependencies

    ```
    npm install [your package] --save-dev
    ```

2. Create a synced npm-shrinkwrap.json with devDependencies included by running

    ```
    npm shrinkwrap --dev
    ```

3. Commit to repository

## Development Setup (Sublime Text Only)

1. Add the following to your Sublime Text User Settings:

  ```json
  {
    ...
    "rulers": [80], // lines no longer than 80 chars
    "tab_size": 2, // use two spaces for indentation
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true, // use spaces for indentation
    "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true, // add newline on save
    "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true, // trim trailing white space on save
    "default_line_ending": "unix"
  }
  ```

2. Add Sublime-linter with jshint & jsxhint:

  * Installing SublimeLinter is straightforward using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installing-via-pc)
  * SublimeLinter-eslint needs a global eslint in your system, see [instructions](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#sublimelinter-eslint)

3. Syntax Highlihgting for files containing JSX

  * Install Babel using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime). From here you can decide to use Babel for all .js files. See their docs for that. If you don't want to do that, continue reading.
  * Installing ApplySyntax using Sublime Package Manager, see [instructions](https://github.com/facelessuser/ApplySyntax)
  * Open up the user configuration file for ApplySyntax: `Sublime Text` -> `Preferences` -> `Package Settings` -> `ApplySyntax` -> `Settings - User`
  * Replace the contents with this:

    ```
    {
      // Put your custom syntax rules here:
      "syntaxes": [
        {
          "name": "Babel/JavaScript (Babel)",
          "rules": [
            {"first_line": "^\\/\\*\\*\\s@jsx\\sReact\\.DOM\\s\\*\\/"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
