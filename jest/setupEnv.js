// this is a workaround to make ts-jest play nice with babel-plugin-macros.
// unfortunately we could not use @babel/preset-typescript, as the decorators we have in the codebase can not be compiled by babel as is.
// the second problem is that ts-jest claims to be multistage (tsc -> babel), but it seems that it somehow does not respect the "target", so
// the output of tsc will mess with the imports so that "@lingui/babel-preset-react" does not pick them up to transform them.
// This means that we'll get a "can't find macro_1" when running tests without this workaround for now.
// It might be worthwhile to dig into ts-jest as to why it's transpiling ts-files differently.
