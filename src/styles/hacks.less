// COPS-6624
// popper.js sometimes seems to think that our reference elements are outside of the viewport and marks them with this attribute.
// ui-kit then chooses to set `visibility: hidden; pointer-events: none;`, which effectively hides the poppers for some OSX users.
// this is a quickfix that we could try removing once we removed FullScreenModal from the code base.
body [data-popper-reference-hidden] {
  visibility: visible !important;
  pointer-events: auto !important;
}
