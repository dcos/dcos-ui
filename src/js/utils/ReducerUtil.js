   * This function is heavily inspired by the combineReducer function from
   * redux. https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/src/combineReducers.js
   *
   * It does await a structured object with a key: value combination where
   * the value is a function that awaits a state and an action. Which is the
   * same format as the usual reducer function does have. The function
   * returns a single reducer function which calls all the functions and
   * returns a object with the key values corresponding to the input.
   *
   * We removed all unnecessary checks which are used in the store use case.
   * And boiled it
   * down to only the bare minimum in code.
   *
   * We also added the feature that each reducer does have it's own context.
   * which gets reset if the passed index is 0.
   *
   * @param {Object} reducers An object whose values correspond to different
   * reducer functions that need to be combined into one.
   *
   * @returns {Function} A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside
   *   the passed object, and builds a state object with the same shape.
