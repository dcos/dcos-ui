By default, it configures Docker with multi-host networking (required to use Calico with the Docker Containerizer), and reboots each Agent to pick up Calico's CNI configuration (required for Calico with Unified tasks). Both of these steps will cause temporary restarts of an Agent causing transient task loss. A more stable approach to Calico in DC/OS will have users performing these steps manually, and disabling them in the Universe Package. At the moment, only a limited set of DC/OS versions and OSes are supported - check the documentation for details.

      "description": "Sysdig Cloud is the first and only monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting solution designed from the ground up to provide unprecedented visibility into containerized infrastructures. Sysdig Cloud comes with built-in, first class support for Mesos, Marathon, and DC/OS.\n\nThis package will automatically deploy the Sysdig Cloud agent container on each Mesos Agent (aka Slave) node in your cluster. Note, for maximum functionality, including full metadata support, you'll still need to manually install the Sysdig Cloud agent container on each of your Mesos Master nodes as well. See the docs for complete instructions: http://support.sysdigcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/207886103",
